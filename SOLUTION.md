# Course Enrollment Issue - Solution

## Problem Identified
Your students are registered correctly in the database, but they're not enrolled in any **batches**. The course display system looks for students in batch schedules, not just course preferences.

## Root Cause
- Students exist in `users` table ✅
- Courses exist in `courses` table ✅ 
- **Missing**: Students are not enrolled in any `batches` ❌

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Run SQL in Supabase Dashboard

Go to your Supabase project → SQL Editor and run this:

```sql
-- Create sample batches and enroll all students
DO $$
DECLARE
    student_ids_array text[];
    course_record record;
    batch_id uuid;
BEGIN
    -- Get all student IDs
    SELECT array_agg(id::text) INTO student_ids_array
    FROM users 
    WHERE role = 'Student' AND is_deleted = false;
    
    -- Create batches for each course and enroll students
    FOR course_record IN SELECT id, name FROM courses
    LOOP
        -- Create batch
        INSERT INTO batches (name, description, course_id, schedule, capacity, mode, is_active)
        VALUES (
            course_record.name || ' - Beginner Batch',
            'Beginner level batch for ' || course_record.name,
            course_record.id,
            jsonb_build_array(
                jsonb_build_object(
                    'timing', 'Monday: 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM',
                    'studentIds', to_jsonb(student_ids_array)
                )
            ),
            20,
            'Online',
            true
        )
        ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
        RETURNING id INTO batch_id;
        
        RAISE NOTICE 'Created batch for %: enrolled % students', course_record.name, array_length(student_ids_array, 1);
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

### Option 2: Use Admin Panel (Recommended)

1. Go to your admin dashboard
2. Navigate to **Batches** section
3. Create new batches for each course:
   - **Bharatanatyam - Beginner Batch**
   - **Vocal - Beginner Batch** 
   - **Drawing - Beginner Batch**
   - **Abacus - Beginner Batch**
4. For each batch, add schedule timings and enroll your students

### Option 3: Manual Database Update

If you want to see immediate results, run this simpler query:

```sql
-- Just enroll all students in the first course batch as a test
UPDATE batches 
SET schedule = '[{"timing": "Monday: 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM", "studentIds": ["your-student-id-1", "your-student-id-2"]}]'::jsonb
WHERE name LIKE '%Bharatanatyam%'
LIMIT 1;
```

## Verify Fix

After running the fix, refresh your student dashboard. You should now see:
- Course cards with enrollment details
- Batch names and timings
- Teacher assignments (if any)
- Mode (Online/Offline)

## Why This Happened

The system expects this enrollment flow:
1. **Student Registration** → Creates user account ✅
2. **Course Selection** → Stores preferences ✅ 
3. **Batch Creation** → Admin creates batches for courses ❌ (Missing)
4. **Student Enrollment** → Admin assigns students to batches ❌ (Missing)

You completed steps 1-2 but missed steps 3-4, which is why courses don't show up in "My Courses".

## Prevention

To prevent this in the future:
1. After registering students, create batches in admin panel
2. Assign students to appropriate batches based on their course preferences
3. Set up proper schedules and timings for each batch
