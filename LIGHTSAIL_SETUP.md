2. **Navigate to Lightsail:**
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for "Lightsail"
   - Click on "Amazon Lightsail"
   - Or directly go to: https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/

## Step 3: Create Your First Instance

1. **Click "Create instance"**

2. **Choose instance location:**
   - Select a region closest to your users (e.g., US East for US users, Asia Pacific for Asian users)
   - Leave the Availability Zone as default

3. **Pick your instance image:**
   - Click "Linux/Unix" (should be selected by default)
   - Under "Select a blueprint", choose "OS Only"
   - Select "Ubuntu 20.04 LTS" or "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS"

4. **Choose your instance plan:**
   - **$3.50/month**: 512 MB RAM, 1 vCPU, 20 GB SSD, 1 TB transfer
   - **$5/month**: 1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 40 GB SSD, 2 TB transfer (Recommended)
   - **$10/month**: 2 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 60 GB SSD, 3 TB transfer

   ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**: Start with the $5/month plan - it's perfect for small to medium websites.

5. **Name your instance:**
   - Give it a name like "nadanaloga-server" or "my-website"
   - You can add tags if you want (optional)

6. **Click "Create instance"**

## Step 4: Wait for Instance to Start

- Your instance will take 1-2 minutes to start
- The status will change from "Pending" to "Running"
- You'll see a green "Running" status when ready

## Step 5: Connect to Your Instance

1. **Get connection details:**
   - Click on your instance name
   - Note down the "Public IP" address
   - Click "Connect using SSH" for browser-based terminal

2. **Connect via browser (easiest method):**
   - Click "Connect using SSH"
   - A new browser window will open with a terminal
   - You're now connected as the `ubuntu` user

3. **Alternative: Connect via your computer (advanced):**
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

## Step 6: Deploy Your Application

Now that your server is running, you can deploy your Nadanaloga application:

1. **In the SSH terminal, run:**
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nadanalogaa/Thillaikadavul/main/deploy.sh
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   sudo ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Wait for deployment to complete** (takes 5-10 minutes)

3. **Update your domain configuration:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/Thillaikadavul
   nano server/.env
   ```
   - Change `CLIENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5500` to `CLIENT_URL=http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP`
   - Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save

4. **Restart the application:**
   ```bash
   pm2 restart nadanaloga-api
   ```

## Step 7: Access Your Website

- Open your browser
- Go to: `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP`
- You should see your Nadanaloga website!

## Step 8: Set Up a Domain (Optional)

1. **Create a static IP:**
   - In Lightsail console, go to "Networking" tab
   - Click "Create static IP"
   - Attach it to your instance
   - Note the static IP address

2. **Configure your domain:**
   - Go to your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
   - Create an "A" record pointing to your static IP

3. **Update your application:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/Thillaikadavul
   nano server/.env
   ```
   - Change `CLIENT_URL` to `https://yourdomain.com`
   - Save and restart: `pm2 restart nadanaloga-api`

4. **Set up SSL certificate:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
   ```

## Cost Breakdown

- **Instance**: $5/month (recommended plan)
- **Static IP**: $0/month (while attached to running instance)
- **Data Transfer**: Included in plan (2TB/month)
- **Total**: ~$5/month

## Useful Commands

Once your server is running:

```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status

# View application logs
pm2 logs

# Restart application
pm2 restart nadanaloga-api

# Update your application
cd /home/ubuntu/Thillaikadavul
git pull origin main
npm run build
pm2 restart nadanaloga-api

# Check server resources
htop

# Check disk space
df -h
```

## Troubleshooting

**Can't connect to website?**
- Check if instance is "Running"
- Verify firewall: `sudo ufw status`
- Check application: `pm2 status`

**Application not starting?**

## Security Tips

1. **Keep your system updated:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Don't share your SSH connection**
3. **Regularly backup your data**
4. **Use HTTPS with a domain name**

## Next Steps

1. Set up a domain name for professional look
2. Configure SSL certificate for HTTPS
